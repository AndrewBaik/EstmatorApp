# EstmatorApp

This tool will be a sales facing UI to support office move salespersons in estimating projects, and providing clients with on-demand proposals during the walkthrough/estimate process.  

# User Stories
* As a user I want a simply tool to assist me in providing customer estimates for my projects so that I may serve my clients faster, and increase the chance of closing a deal quickly.
* As a user I want the interface to be easy to navigate across a large dataset of categories and items so that I can complete my walkthrough and estimate quickly and without having to stop and double check my work.
* As a user I want the ability to work offline so that I can begin a project estimate without troubling my client for a wifi connection.
* As a user I want to send my client an email including the final proposal before I leave their office so that I may provide them an on-demand service while still meeting face to face and creating a personal connection.
* As a user I want to be able to adjust the calculations of my estimate to suit my specific requirements so that I may provide an estimate that's closely in line with my traditional estimate process. 
* As a management user I want the ability to manage my sales team by adding and editing status and user information so that I may be self sufficient and not rely on a vendor to manage my system.
